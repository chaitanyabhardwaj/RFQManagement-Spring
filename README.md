Spring boot full stack application developed during an internship<br>
### Project Overview
<p>A leading manufactring industry wants to develop middleware services for handling "request for quote" processing in their organisation. The manufactring industry has a small plant that assembles various types of machineries. In order to do this, the industry wants to buy several parts from it's suppliers that addresses the machine design, material choice, and price expectations.</p>
<p>To identify a supplier who can support in providing high quality produt with a reasonable price at the point of need, the industry floats "Request for quote"(RFQ) to all its suppliers. Detailed RFQs allow suppliers to prepare accurate quotes that minimize the potential cost for overruns, delivery delays and at the same time meets the product requirements.</p>
<p>The middleware services of the manufactring firm will have to collate the needs of products/services from it's manufactring plant. The inputs needed for prepareing a comprehensive RFQ must be provided ny the services.</p>
<p>There will also be an Admin portal, called as "Fabricate" that has to be developed part of this scope that consumes these microservices and helps the admin staffs with needed data fir RFQ preparation.</p>
